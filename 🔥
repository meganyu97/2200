combustion is a fascinating concept
when fuel and oxidants collide, 
it can either create the energy needed for the propulsion of the most groundbreaking discoveries
or engulf a familyâ€™s home, descended through generations
leaving nothing but grieving ashes behind. 
i dream to be a combustion of odds stacked against me and gritty, stubborn determination. 
i dream to be magnesium on fire
burning so hot that, even underwater, 
the extinguishers soaking you in allay attempts only cause you to burn stronger
all while acknowledging the possibility
that I may be igniting my own cremation
